# 🛍️ Retail Customer Behavior Analysis – Power BI & Python

## 🔎 Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing retail customer behavior** using **Python** and **Power BI** for customer segmentation, revenue trends, and retention strategies. By leveraging **RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**, the project identifies **MVP, Loyal, Best, Big spenders, new customers** for better marketing decision-making.

## 🏗️ Steps Followed in the Project  

### **1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
✔️ Downloaded transaction data using **Kaggle API** in Jupyter Notebook.  
✔️ Loaded and merged **two large datasets (~500,000 records, 2021 & 2022)** using **Pandas**.  
✔️ Cleaned missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted dates to ensure **100% data integrity**.  

### **2️⃣ Customer Segmentation – RFM Model**  
✔️ Calculated **Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (total purchases), and Monetary (total revenue per customer)**.  
✔️ Segmented **1M+ customers** into **MVP, Best, Loyal, Spenders, and New Customers**.  
✔️ Created a **Power Query function in Power BI** to automate segmentation dynamically.  

### **3️⃣ Revenue & Retention Analysis**  
✔️ Calculated **Total Revenue ($4.12 billion), Avg CLV ($ 7.74k ), Retention Rate (24%), and AOV (4.38k)**.  
✔️ Analyzed customer retention trends and identified **top-performing zones contributing 75% of total revenue**.  
✔️ Explored **impact of discounts** on repeat purchases using Power BI visuals.  

### **4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard Creation**  
✔️ Designed an **interactive dashboard** with:  
   - 📌 **KPI Cards** for total revenue, retention rate, total Customers,Avg customer life value, purchase frequency.  
   - 📊 **Treemap & Bar Charts** for customer segmentation.  
   - 📈 **Trend Analysis** for revenue over time.  
   - 🌍 **Regional Performance Map** showing store-wise customer trends.  

### **5️⃣ Insights & Business Impact**  
✔️ Identified **high-value customers (MVPs) who contribute the majority of revenue**.  
✔️ Found that **discounted purchases had a 22% higher retention rate**.  
✔️ Provided **actionable insights for targeted marketing** and store-level sales strategies.
